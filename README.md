## How we utilised our technology?

Before we started building the product, we considered alot of things which included: demographic, ease of use, and economic class of our target users. We eventually decided to leverage on Android (User side) because of the increasing number of mobile penetration in our country, and we also leveraged on progressive web apps (Restaurant side) because of the great usage of desktop computers in most of the restaurants within the country. 

## What motivated us to build this project?

We want to make it possible for people to eat happily without worrying to pay physical cash after meal. We want people to focus more on eating healthy food rather than worrying over the huge stress of making payments after meal. We believe that people should feed well with minimal stress and that is why we're building a solution to solve this problem using technology.

## Impact on the users?

Food is one of the most basic human needs- everyone, including the rich and poor, must eat to survive. As more Africans (especially those living in cities) cannot find the time, convenience or skill to cook for themselves, eating at fast food and casual dining restaurants is on a rapid rise. We have seen that the traditional way of delivering customer service in this business isn't the most effective method. Now, integrating technology into the system would definitely be a Game changer. This new advancement will give rise to a redefined industry where there's 100% customer satisfaction and huge value creation in the industry.
